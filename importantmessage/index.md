### Dear Star, Baggy and InsertSoda

Firstly i want to thank all of you, i gained experience, i had fun, i really enjoyed being in this project with you guys, i loved helping on a project with people that i aways look up to! Thanks again to Star for giving me the chance of participating on this project, it's my first time participating on something this big, and i am really excited for future projects, but this letter is not about this.

I appreciate the community and the game, that was my motivation to start contribuiting and helping people in the community, with my plugins, or with verbal help. This is an example, i am creating something with you guys, that will help a lot of players, a lot of people in general in their programming journey, this year i am actually restarting my programming journey, but that's not the point. 

Since Star called me on Community Bot's server to see the project, i got starstruck with the project, and i actually wanted to help on the development, so i did, my first PR was a front page re-design, exactly as i did on [docs.polytoria.com](https://docs.polytoria.com). Contributing would also be a chance of learning Lua, and other programming languages at the same time. Which would be pretty helpful to me to get back at the _**Programming Trackâ„¢**_.

But there is something that i have been feeling since a couple of weeks ago, and that is lack of transparency, i made a pull request a few weeks ago, and Index told me he would review it and ask Star what if they would merge or if they would reject it, that was the last time in weeks i heard of the pull request. I understand, everyone makes their own thing, or is busy with other projects, but i see the github webhook going wild in the last days.

After a couple of days, i asked Index if they were planning to release and what was the status, the only thing he told me was "we have discussed about it" and the conversation ðŸ’€, today Willem referenced the project, and told InsertSoda to "make a pull request", and i decided to ask again, and nothing. Again i understand that you guys are busy with your own things, Index was aways telling me what was happening in Poly+, InsertSoda with the TD project, but i can see that you guys had sometime to make some changes and stuff...

Today, i see messages being send in the github channel, and surprise! a contributors page, i went to see what was in it, and... I only got credited by "2 icons" and "moral support", i am still very happy with my mention but at the same time depreciated, i did 4-5 pull requests with missing features, one good adition on the "Setting up" creator, and the 2 week pull request, and i only got credited for this, basically. It hurts to see people that i looked up to doing something like this to me. I am not saying "oH I jUST WaNt to bE cReDited", i am just trying to show you that this is not cool. Both situations made me think a lot, i don't want to leave the project, i don't want to be removed from anything, i still want to help the community that i love.

With love and care, ItsLuiggiYahoo
